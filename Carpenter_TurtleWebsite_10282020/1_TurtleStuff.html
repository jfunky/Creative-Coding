<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to the Turtle Aquarium!!</h1>
<break>
<p> Turtles are reptiles of the order <i>Testudines</i>. They are characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield. "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling <i>Testudines</i> (British English). <i>Testudines</i> includes both extant (living) and extinct species. Its earliest known members date from the Middle Jurassic. Turtles are one of the oldest reptile groups, more ancient than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 356 known extant species, some are highly endangered.</p>

<p>Turtles are ectotherms—commonly called cold-blooded—meaning that their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment. However, because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water. Turtles are classified as <i>amniotes</i>, along with other reptiles, birds, and mammals. Like other <i>amniotes</i>, turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.</p>
